# Neural Network

The aim of this project is to provide simple Java implementation of neural networks.

This project's value is more theoretical than practical.

The purpose is to make neural networks workable and understandable for a Java programmer.

The target audience is only one person - me.

## TODO list:

1. Implement softmax output function.
2. Implement mini-batch gradient descent.
3. Implement learning rate online tuning.
4. Implement input shifting and scaling.
5. Implement momentum.
6. Implement adaptive learning rates for each connection.
