# Neural Network

The aim of this project is to provide simple Java implementation of neural networks.

This project's value is more theoretical than practical.

The purpose is to make neural networks workable and understandable for a Java programmer.

The target audience is only one person - me.

## TODO list:

1. Implement softmax output function.
2. Implement mini-batch gradient descent.
3. Implement learning rate online tuning.
4. Implement input shifting and scaling.
5. Implement standard momentum.
6. Implement Nesterov momentum.
7. Implement adaptive learning rates for each connection.
8. Implement rprop for full batch learning.
9. Implement rmsprop for mini-batch learning.
